Squares

This game was coded as my first pure Javascript project. The game instructions are below!

Game Instructions: 

The top of the page will display an RGB Color Value, as the player you must select the square that matches that value.

Easy Mode: You will have to select the appropriate square of the 3 squares displayed. A Correct answer gives you 5 points and an incorrect answer deducts 3 points from your score. Your score is unable to fall below 0.

Hard Mode: You will have to select the appropriate square of the 6 squares displayed. A Correct answer gives you 10 points and an incorrect answer deducts 5 points from your score. Your score is unable to fall below 0.
